# Advent of Code 2024
This year, I used Nushell to solve the problems.

## Structure
The problem input I received is located in the `input` folder.
The code lives in the `aoc2024` module.

## Usage
* Load the module: `use aoc2024`
* Then run the problem: `open input/1.txt | aoc2024 1 a` *to run problem 1, part a*
